#Classes/Types/ADT:- a written description of the attributes and behaviors of an object
Blueprint
object- an instance of a class
a physical representation of the blueprint
Fields
#Attributes : Instance Variables
# Behaviors: Instance Methods
##Syntax:

accessModifier class NameofClass {


}

# Behaviors: Constructors, setters and getters, equals , toString, compareTo
#Constructors: It is a special method that shares the same name as the class.
 It initializes the instance variables and initializes the object.
#Setters - mutators they modify the values of the instance variable
# Getters: - Accessors, they retrieve the values of the instance variable

# The four pillars of OOPL: Polymorphism, Encapuslation, Abstractions, inheritance

  - Polymorphism = poly = multiple ; morphism = fares;
  
  Encapsulation- limiting the access to data by encapusating it in private attributes and controlling access through setters and getters


#Behaviors: Constructors, setters and getters, equals, toString, compareTo

#Constructors: special method that share the same name as the class, it does not have a return type, it initializes the instance
variables and instances initialize the object
#setters : mutators, they modify the values of the instance variables
Getters: accessors , the retrieve the valuesof the instance variables

#Four Pillars of OOPL: Polymorphism, Encapsulation,abstraction and inheritance

- Polymorphism Poly = Multiple, morphirsm = fores;

Encapsulation: lisitng the access to data by encapsulating it in private attributes and controlling access through getters and setters
