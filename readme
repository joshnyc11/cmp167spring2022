Loops : It is a block of code that repeats itself.
# while loop

#Syntax :

while (condition) {

statements
}

## Sentinel Value

- sentinel value is a value the while loop is always keeping an eye out for

###true
it will run forever until there is a breaking condition inside

##Example 

 while ( true) {
 statements 
 
  if (condition) {
   flag = false;
  }

### flag

a boolean value that is first set to true, and there is condition inside the loop that will change the value to false.

##
example-

while (flag) {

Statements 

if (condition) {

flag = false;
  }

}


### Incrementing
- this while loop has a condition that will change as the variable inside (counter)will change the value of the flag 


while ( n < 100 ) 

n++;


#do while loop

do {

statements 

}

while ( condition);

##Semantics 

evaluate inner statements
check the whole condition
if condition is true go to step 1
if condition is false end the loop

# for loop
 
 ## Syntax:
 
 for (   ) {
 
 
 
 }


start code :  initialization code
stop code:  condition, if condition is false it will stop
step code : incrementing code

## semantics

1 run start code for the first iteration only
check step condition
if condition is true, execute inner statements, and then go to step code. go to step 2
if condition is false end the loop

## example using accumulator pattern

int num = 0;

 for { int i = i; i <= 10; i++) {
 
 
 sum = sum + i;
 }

# for each loop

String [] names = "Maria", "Akin" , "Julia"


for : String tempName : names 

System.out.println(tempName);
# do while loop 

this loop will at least repeat once without checking the condition
